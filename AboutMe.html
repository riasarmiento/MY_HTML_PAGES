    <h1>About MySelf</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Ria Anne Claire R. Sarmiento, and I am a 21 year-old individual who is passionate about learning new things in cooking. I was born and raised in Santa Maria, Bulacan and had the opportunity to experience a diverse range of cultures and perspectives throughout my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Education has always been a top priority for me, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology in Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Santa Maria Bulacan Campus. I am committed to excelling academically and actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in this field. 
    </p>   
    <p>
        In my free time, you can often find me engaging in my favorite hobby, which is playing with my furbabies. Looking ahead, I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills I acquire throughout my educational journey to contribute meaningfully to society and make a lasting impact. I am open to embracing new opportunities and challenges that come my way and am excited about the possibilities that the future holds.
